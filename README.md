This project includes a website that simplifies the process of creating the setup.py file for PyPI. The website provides users with a list of all available classifiers, which can be selected by simply clicking on them. Once the user has selected all the relevant classifiers, they can generate the code for their PyPI project with just a few clicks.

This streamlined process can save developers time and effort, allowing them to focus on the more important aspects of their PyPI project. With this website, developers can quickly and efficiently generate the necessary code to get their project up and running.

To get started, simply visit the website and select the relevant classifiers for your project. Once you have made your selections, generate the code and add it to your PyPI project.
